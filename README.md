# Express Backend Generator
This project was made to speed up the process of creating a backend for a web application. It uses the terminal and lets you generate the necessary code to get started.

# Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, you can run `npm install express-backend-generator` to install the project.

# Usage
When the project is installed, you can run the command `npx create-express-backend` to generate the necessary code for your backend. This will create a new folder with the name of your project, and inside that folder, you will find the necessary files to get started.

# Features
## Multi Lauage Support
This project supports both JavaScript and TypeScript. You can choose which language you want to use when generating the code.

## Select your database
You can choose which database you want to use when generating the code.

Currently supported databases:
- MongoDB

## Cors
You can choose whether you want to use cors or not when generating the code.

# Future
I plan to add more features to this project in the future, such as:
- Support for more databases
- Support for more languages
- Support for more frameworks
- Support for component generation
- Support for git initialization
- Support for docker
